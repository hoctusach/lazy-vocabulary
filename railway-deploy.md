# Railway Backend Deployment

## Steps:

1. **Sign up at railway.app**
2. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

3. **Deploy backend:**
   ```bash
   cd railway-backend
   railway login
   railway up
   ```

4. **Get your backend URL:**
   - Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-project.railway.app`

## Test Backend:
Visit: `https://your-project.railway.app/docs` for API documentation

## AWS S3 Issue:
Your AWS credentials need to be reconfigured. Run:
```bash
aws configure
```
And carefully enter your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key without any extra characters.

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy Railway backend first
2. Fix AWS credentials  
3. Deploy frontend to S3
4. Update frontend to use Railway backend URL
