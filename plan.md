# Backend Refactoring Plan

## Objective
Consolidate five separate backend units into one unified backend service for the Lazy Vocabulary application.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Five backend units implemented with DDD architecture
- ✅ Frontend React app with local storage-based vocabulary service
- ✅ Comprehensive user stories and domain models defined
- ❌ Backend units not integrated with frontend
- ❌ Complex multi-unit architecture for simple MVP needs

## Refactoring Steps

### Step 1: Create Unified Backend Structure
- [x] Create new unified backend directory structure
- [x] Consolidate domain models from all units
- [x] Merge value objects and entities
- [x] Combine repository interfaces

### Step 2: Implement Core Services
- [x] Create unified service layer combining all unit functionalities
- [x] Implement user management (auth, sessions)
- [x] Implement vocabulary management (CRUD, search)
- [x] Implement progress tracking (SRS, reviews)
- [x] Implement data migration capabilities
- [x] Implement basic analytics

### Step 3: Create API Layer
- [x] Design unified REST API endpoints
- [x] Implement controllers for all functionalities
- [x] Add request/response models
- [x] Include error handling and validation

### Step 4: Infrastructure Layer
- [x] Implement in-memory repositories for demo
- [x] Create service factory for dependency injection
- [x] Add event publishing mechanism
- [x] Include demo scripts

### Step 5: Integration and Testing
- [x] Create comprehensive demo script
- [x] Test all functionalities work together
- [x] Verify integration points
- [x] Document API usage

## Success Criteria
- [x] Single backend service handles all user stories
- [x] Maintains all existing functionality
- [x] Simplified architecture suitable for MVP
- [x] Working demo script demonstrates all features
- [x] Clear integration path with frontend

## Notes
- Keep existing frontend unchanged for now
- Focus on backend consolidation only
- Maintain DDD principles but in single bounded context
- Prepare for future frontend integration
